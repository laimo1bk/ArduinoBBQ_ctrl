# ArduinoBBQ_ctrl
Arduino sketch for temperature control fan

This is a hobby project intended to create a produt that reads temperature of a grill/smoker as well as the food inside. 
Temperature range will drive the controll of an fan to moderate airflow. 

User will interface via LCD screen and navigate menu via button inputs. 

Core development
Temp input into range triggers fan control. 
    Fan to have hi low range depending on temp delta over set point

Future  development
Wifi communication with mobile device for recording and alert funtions.
