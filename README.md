# ArduinoBBQ_ctrl
Arduino based solution for temperature regulation of a grill or smoker. 

This is a hobby project intended to utilize an Arduino Uno to create a produt that reads temperature of a grill/smoker as well as the food inside. Temperature range of the grill will drive the controll of an fan to regulate airflow. 

User will interface via LCD screen and navigate menu via button inputs. 

Core development
>> Grill temp input range triggers fan control on/off 

>> Fan to have hi low range depending on temp delta over set point

Future  development
Wifi communication with mobile device for history and alert funtions.
